* Rural rider:driver ratio = 125:78 = 1.6
* Suburban rider:driver ratio = 625:490 = 125:98 = 6.4
* Urban rider:driver ratio =1625:2405= 0.68

There's only a $15 difference in fare price for riders between rural and urban, but nearly a $40 difference in how much rural and urban drivers get paid.

## Recommendations
  
There are more urban drivers than urban riders. Ideally there should be more riders. Many individual drivers need a steady stream of jobs to make a sufficient living, especially in a city, but individual riders likely do not need to constantly be in transit. Additionally, while the oversaturation of urban drivers has slightly driven down the fare price in urban areas, it also mean that there are fewer jobs per driver. 
  
 **Urban drivers are not making sufficient profit, both because of their service not being as valuable with increased availability of rides, but also because there are few jobs per worker.**

To better meet the needs of riders, and also to create a more equitable pay situation for drivers, some urban drivers should be incentivized to work in suburban and rural areas. There is a larger gap between riders and drivers in suburban areas than rural areas, so a larger proportion of drivers should offer their services in suburban areas.

Profit from urban fares already account for more than rural and suburban fares combined. In addition to better meeting the needs of riders and drivers, this will likely cause urban fares to rise as the driver market becomes less saturated, while the rider population remains more or less the same. This would generate increased profit for the company. A portion of which could be used to compensate urban-based drivers for their gas mileage to suburban and rural areas. Well worth it for the potential gains.
  
While this change could cause a decrease in the average fare price for rural and urban areas, the maximum difference in average fare prices between the three areas is only $10. Despite rural areas having the highest fares, they make up the smallest share of profits. Thus a reduction of their fare prices would largely be inconsequential compared to an increase in fare prices for urban areas. Additionally, a reduction in fare prices for rural areas could make ride share services more accessible, thus increasing the clientele.

## To Summarize:
  
* Incentivize urban drivers to work in suburban and rural areas, with more going to the suburbs. 
* Reduce the fare price for rural fares to increase accessibility of transportation in areas where forms of public transit are already limited. 
* Increase the fare for urban rides to both reflect the more appropriately saturated market, as well as increase the salary of the remaining urban drivers.
